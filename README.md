<--links.html-->

Hyperlinks are defined using the a> tag. 
The a> tag has two attributes. 
The first attribute of the  a> tag is the href(URL address) attribute, which indicates the link's destination. 
The second attribute is the link text. Itâ€™s the part that will be visible to the user of the website. 
By clicking on the link text, the user will be sent to the  abov specified URL address.

by default when user clicks the  linktext it will display the linkedpage   in the current window
so if  we want to display the linkedpage   in the new window we have to use target attribute
